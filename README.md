## Gameplay

The aim of the game is to guide the dolphin through a sequence of rings. The rings appear as one of two colours: green or blue. The player must switch the dolphin to the correct colour via the Oculus Touch shoulder triggers. The player loses health if they pass through a ring and fail to do so. The player must also avoid the marine animals which obstruct the pathway. The game has an escalating tempo which is divided into 10 levels. The game ends on completion of the final level, or if the player dies.

## Audio
The music and sound effects were created in Ableton.

- I composed an ambient house themed track, that provides an escalating tempo. 
- The SFX are either percussive elements or electronic sounds that were pitched melodically. 

## Visuals
The gameplay and reactive visuals were created in Unity. 

- The dolphin passes through rings that pulse to the 4/4 time signature of the score.

- The concentric circles in the background are beat synchronised musical layers (e.g. the blue circle corresponds to the shaker track of the musical score).
